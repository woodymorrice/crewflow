***Part 2***

*Product Description*
Our product will be an employee management system designed to cater to the needs of small to
medium-sized businesses. It will be a web-based platform that facilitates seamless communication 
among employees, streamlines administrative tasks for management, and provides valuable insights 
into employee schedules and payroll.

*Needs and Value*
Our product will allow companies to manage their workforce 
efficiently and effortlessly by centralizing employee data, enhancing communication, and simplifying 
administrative tasks, all within a single user-friendly platform.  While there are existing employee 
management solutions, our product will set itself apart through its user-friendliness and flexibility. 
It will be designed to be an accessible, scalable, and cost-efficient choice. 

*Stakeholder*
Our stakeholder is Mark 
Diakiw, manager of SaskMade Marketplace, a local gourmet grocery store located on 8th Street. 

*Tech Requirements*
Our project will be developed using a combination of Django Web Framework for Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
