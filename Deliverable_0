Part 2

Rough ideas:
Our product will be an employee management system for a small to medium company. A website where the employees can communicate with themselves, where the owner can add and remove members (employees) and edit their information. Look at employees schedule, payroll, etc.
This product can be used by any company that has employees, for example: supermarkets, liquor stores, boutiques, etc.
